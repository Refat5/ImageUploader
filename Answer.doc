       when user faced this issue then i  would like to some question to user .
       
       1/ First of all I will ask the user to check his internet speed  
       2/ Does it download slowly on your device or does it download fine on other devices?
       3/ Are there any large files in your list?
       4/ Is this problem already in the system? Or just happening today
       
       If there is an issue on the user side then I will tell the user how he can fix it
       or if this issue generate from our system Then we will make some changes to our system ..
       
        -> Compress the data to zip file before downloading, it should be reduce the file size 
        -> remove unnecessary data before downloading
        -> divide the data into smaller then download 
        -> Downloading 100 employee information instead of downloading 1000 employee information at once
